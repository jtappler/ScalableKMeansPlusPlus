# Draft of Unit Tests

**Will verify the code correctness using following tests:**

1. Test the distance using both ***k*-means++** and ***k*-means||** algorithms to verify the results
2. Test distance function using examples in terms of: 
  - symmetry
  - zero
  - non-negativity 
3. Bechmark test compare the efficiency of ***k*-means++** and ***k*-means||** algorithms.
